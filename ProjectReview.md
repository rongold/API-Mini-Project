### Sprint 1

[Friday]

##### Team

The Team is composed of three individuals: Ronil Goldenwalla, Tak Li and Samuel Adedina.

##### Choosing API Framework to create

At the start of Sprint 1, simple discussion to understand the teams interest on what API framework to create. An API that allows to 'GET' information and cross-check it back with the server.

After looking at the comprehensive list of [API's](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)

Animal Crossing was chosen due to the respective admiration and nostalgic feeling for the game.

### In Conclusion

| What we learnt                 | What to do for next time                            |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| How to collaborate with others | Test for the API Headers                            |
| Effectively solve blockers     | Pick an API with POST (Maybe PUT or DELETE) as well |
| Test APIs                      |                                                     |
